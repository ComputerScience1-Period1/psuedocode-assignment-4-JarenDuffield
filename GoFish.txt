//original
Shuffle cards.
Pass 1 card to each person.


Repeat until each person has recieved 5 cards including the dealer:
        place the rest of the deck in the middle of the players = draw deck
        While each player recieved cards:
                if in ascending order
                        leave it
                else
                        put in ascending order from 2 to Ace.
        if you recieve all 4 of a card:
                Place down all 4 cards for a point
        else
                Don't put cards down.
        
//Example if you are dealt all 4 aces and 1 King put the 4 aces down gaining that point.
     
        While player asks for a card:
                if card in their deck:
                        ask
                else:
                        don't ask
    
        if player asks you for card:
                If you have cards:
                        give cards of value
                else:
                        say Go Fish
        
//Example if the one player asks you for a 3, give all 3's if not Go Fish.
        
        if person recieved the card they asked for:
                repeat turn
        else if person didn't recieve card they ask
    If the person didn't recieve card they asked for:
        pull a card from deck
    Else if the person recieved the card they asked for:
        Repeat turn:
             
    Else if you have run out of cards:
        If you run out of cards draw 5 from deck
        If deck < 5 take all cards.
        If no cards in deck wait until game is over.
        
    Repeat turns until cards are empty:
        If cards for everyone have emptied, count points to find winner
        If player has all 4 of a card they have one point
        If the 4 matching cards are face cards or 2-10 cards they are same value in points+ 
        // Count all points and add up
        If player has more points than the other players they win
        If tie no winner.
  
//You win if you end the game with more points than your opponent
  One point = 4 of same card value
  Count points to find winner.
