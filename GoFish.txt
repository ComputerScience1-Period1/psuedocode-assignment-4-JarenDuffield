// Go Fish is a card game that uses all 52 cards in the deck.


Players sit in a circle, or around a table.
Shuffle cards.
Pass 1 card to each person, in a clockwise order.
Repeat until each person has recieved 5 cards including the dealer:
        Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the circle.
        The cards in the middle are now the draw deck.
        While each player recieved cards:
               
         If you recieve all 4 of a card:
                Place down all 4 cards for a point
         Else:
                Don't put cards down.
         then:
                order cards from ace to king
        
//Example if you are dealt all 4 aces and 1 King put the 4 aces down gaining that point.:
       While player asks for a card it must be a card in their deck
                If not they can't ask
        Else if player asks you for card:
                If you have cards give cards of value:
        If not say Go Fish:
         
    If the person didn't recieve card they asked for pull a card from draw deck:
        If the person recieves the card they asked for:
     Then:
        Repeat turn:
        If not turn is over.
        If you have run out of cards:
                If you run out of cards draw 5 from deck
        If deck < 5:
                take remaining cardsin deck.
        If no cards in deck:
                then next player's turn.
        
    Repeat turns until cards are empty:
        If cards for everyone have emptied:
                count points to find winner
        If player has all 4 of a card:
                add one point
        // Count all points and add up
        If player has more points than the other players they win
        If equal amount of points then tie.
